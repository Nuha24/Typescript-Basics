I have covered the basics of TS here to learn! 
Basic Types: Primitive types, reference types (objects, arrays, functions, classes).
Advanced Types: Tuples, Enums, Any, Unknown, Never, Union, Intersection.
Objects & Interfaces: Type aliases, optional properties, readonly properties.
Functions & Methods: Function overloading, type narrowing, generics, rest/spread parameters.
OOP Concepts: Classes, access modifiers (public, private, protected), getters/setters, inheritance.
Design Patterns: Factory Pattern, Singleton Pattern, Observer Pattern, Strategy Pattern, Iterator Pattern.
Generics: Using generics with functions, interfaces, and classes.
Other Features: Enum usage, discriminated unions, instance checks, TypeScript-JavaScript conversion examples.
